### Hi there 👋

I'm an Senior Computer Science Enginner pursuing my undergraduate studies at Vellore Institute of Technology

I’m currently learning SvelteKit, with my areas of interest being Computer Vision and Deep Learning. I've worked on Designing and developing Front-End User Interfaces with Figma for both Mobile and Web Applications, and I've had some experience developing Flutter applications for personal projects as well

In my free time, you can find me helping fellow Guardians reclaim lost sectors and fend off the Darkness, in the world of Destiny 2
